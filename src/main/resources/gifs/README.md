# GIFs

The default urls for the different GIF commands are stored here in separate JSON files.
While the user could add GIFs that are not safe for work, the standard GIFs should all be safe for work since every inserted default GIF from here is marked as safe for work (see [InitGifs.kt](../../kotlin/com/github/hannesbraun/katarina/database/InitGifs.kt)).
